/**
 * 
 * 
 * On this link we can see that no of priorities are very less as compare to no
 * of tasks running on a system
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)
 * 
 * 1. Solaris uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging between 0
 * and 169. 2. In Linux 2.4, an O(n) scheduler with a multilevel feedback queue
 * with priority levels ranging from 0 to 140 was used; 0–99 are reserved for
 * real-time tasks and 100–140 are considered nice task levels. 3. Windows
 * NT-based operating systems use a multilevel feedback queue. 32 priority
 * levels are defined, 0 through to 31, with priorities 0 through 15 being
 * "normal" priorities and priorities 16 through 31 being soft real-time
 * priorities, requiring privileges to assign.
 * 
 * no of tasks can be much more than no of priorities so having an array of size
 * equal to no of priorities and just storing reference of top of a queue will
 * consume very less space constant space complexity O(1) and all operation pop
 * a process with K priority = O(1) peek a process with K priority = O(1) delete
 * a process with K priority = O(1) push a process with K priority = O(1)
 * 
 * so every my known processes will be with constant time complexity O(1)
