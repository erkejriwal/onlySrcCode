	 * Jamie is walking along a number line that starts at point 0 and ends at
	 * point n. She can move either one step to the left or one step to the
	 * right of her current location , with the exception that she cannot move
	 * left from point 0 or right from point n. In other words, if Jamie is
	 * standing at point i,she can move to either i-1 or i+1 as long as her
	 * destination exists in the inclusive range [0,n]. She has a string ,s , of
	 * movement instruction consisting of the letters 1 and r , where 1 is an
	 * instruction to move one step left and r is an instruction to move one
	 * step right. Jamie followed the instructions in s one by one and in order
	 * .For Example if s=‘rrlr’,she performs the following sequence of moves
	 * :one step right ->one step right ->one step left -> one step right .Jamie
	 * wants to move from point x to point y following some subsequence of
	 * string s instruction and wonders how many distinct possible subsequence
	 * of string s will get her from point x to point y. recall that a
	 * subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters
	 * from string .
	 * 
	 * it has four parameters A String , s giving a sequence of eduction using
	 * the characters l( i.e. move left one unit ) and r (i.e. move right one
	 * unit) An integer n, denoting the length of the number line. An integer x,
	 * denoting jamie’s starting point on the number line An integer y ,
	 * denoting Jamie’s enidng point on the number line. The function must
	 * return an integer denoting the total number of distinct subsequence of
	 * string s that will lead Jamie from point x to point y as this value cab
	 * be quite large .
